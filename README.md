### Data Protection
All user data is stored **locally on the client machine** within the directory defined by the .NET runtime’s local application data path:
`Environment.SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData` 

At runtime, the application creates and uses a dedicated subdirectory under this location. On Windows systems, this typically resolves to:
`C:\Users\<UserName>\AppData\Local\MessengerView` 

No user data is transmitted, processed, or stored externally. All information remains confined to the local file system and is accessible only to the current user account.
